		The skies have opened up once again pouring heavy rain. A few steps away, you recognize
		the figure of a car. That's a nice car you don't see every day in this neighbourhood.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The drivers window lowers and a trembled voice speaks to you.<br/>
		Client: " Ehmm... you.. you were late. "<br/>
		Detective: " With heavy rain is not easy to go on foot. "<br/>
		Client: " Anyway... Anyway... I think it was a murder! "<br/>
		Detective: " Well, who murdered who? "<br/>
		Client: " The death of my father! "<br/>
		Detective: " And...? "<br/>
		Client: " Isn't that obvious? You have to investigate the case! "
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The hand of the young man with a stuffed envelope comes out of the window.<br/>
		Client: " Take these money in advance. "<br/>
		It's been a long time since you saw so much money.<br/>
		Client: " Tomorrow at 6 p.m. we meet in my mansion? St. Charles Avenue 12, Garden District. "
