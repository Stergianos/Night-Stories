		My dear diary... bah... I am too old for this shit! Same shitty bourbon, same shitty neighbourhood.
		All those things consist one more of my "normal" nights, and life goes on and on.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Well, you know... New Orleans is not the city you want to be those days. Most jobs in the port and
		the construction department are almost dead. The city is in deep economic crisis and as if all
		these were not enough, I have to stand this damn rain day after day.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		To be a detective was not like I imagined it when I was green. Catching bad guys and stuff...
		Childish thoughts. At least I have a case now...
